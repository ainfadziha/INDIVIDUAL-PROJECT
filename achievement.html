        <p>I have reached a number of noteworthy milestones in my academic career that have influenced both my professional and academic growth. Getting a degree in Information Science with honors from UiTM Machang is one of my finest accomplishments.</p> <p>This success is a direct result of my commitment to studying hard and maintaining a high GPA while doing exceptionally well on my assignments.</p>

            <p>Apart from my outstanding academic performance, I also took part in a lot of extracurricular activities and held leadership positions.</p> I got 3.83 cgpa on STPM and some perfect scores for SPM. <p> I'm involved in sports in addition to my academics. I regularly attend netball competitions and training sessions.

            <p>As a web designer, I have accomplished a number of goals that have really aided in my professional development.</p>
            <p>Leading the redesign of a significant e-commerce website, which increased user engagement by 30% and sales by 20%, is one of my finest accomplishments.</p>
            <p>Through the use of my user experience (UX) design and conversion rate optimization talents, some projects helped me to create an interface that is ultimately more user-friendly and intuitive.</p>
